# QIcsMediaInfo
Qt Wrapper for MediaInfo

This is a small wrapper for MediaInfo that uses MediaInfoLib, builds using Qt's qmake system and produces only JSon output. It is meant as an example on how to use MediaInfoLib from Qt and can show quickly what can be done with the library. 

For the time being QIcsMediaInfo requires to be built against the static libraries built with my personal forks of MediaInfoLib and ZenLib found here:

https://github.com/rokrau/MediaInfoLib

https://github.com/rokrau/ZenLib

Both of these can be compiled as static libraries using qmake with .pro files found in the respective Contrib directories. 

Discalaimer: This work is mentioned in one of my Blogs that can be found at www.ics.com.
